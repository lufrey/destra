    The project was launched in 2021 at the Berlin University of Applied
    Sciences as a student project of the "Humanoid Robotics" course. The task
    was to develop a robotic hand compatible with the Franka Emika Panda robot
    and capable of grasping various benchmarks. under the direction of Prof. Dr.
    Hannes HÃ¶ppner, director of the Soft Interactive Robotics Laboratory
    (SIRo-Lab), 7 different graspers and hands were developed

    After the project was completed, we became interested and continued to
    develop our hand. We documented the process on social media platforms such
    as twitter and were able to attract the attention of named manufacturers
    such as ROBOTIS.

  <TextSection title="What is our goal?" bright={true}>
    Our goal is to significantly reduce the costs of robotic components and
    prostheses through the novel additive manufacturing method of 3D-printing.
    This can make robotics accessible to more people, which can be particularly
    useful in teaching. The manufacturing process also enables individualization
    of the parts and fast production.
