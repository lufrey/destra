          The project was launched in 2021 at the Berlin University of Applied
          Sciences as a student project of the "Humanoid Robotics" course. The
          task was to develop a robotic hand compatible with the Franka Emika
          Panda robot and capable of grasping various benchmarks. under the
          direction of Prof. Dr. Hannes HÃ¶ppner, director of the Soft
          Interactive Robotics Laboratory (SIRo-Lab), 7 different graspers and
          hands were developed

          After the project was completed, we became interested and continued to
          develop our hand. We documented the process on social media platforms
          such as twitter and were able to attract the attention of named
          manufacturers such as ROBOTIS.

      <p class="max-w-screen-sm m-auto font-light text-center fadein">
        Our goal is to significantly reduce the costs of robotic components and
        prostheses through the novel additive manufacturing method of
        3D-printing. This can make robotics accessible to more people, which can
        be particularly useful in teaching. The manufacturing process also
        enables individualization of the parts and fast production.
