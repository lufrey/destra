    The fingers single components are fully 3D printed and have two ball
    bearings per joint. These reduce friction during grasping and ensure a
    longer service life. The protective cover is screwed on at the side using
    threaded inserts.

  <TextSection title="Polyurthan coating" bright={false} imageAlign="left">
    The fingers are covered by a protective layer of polyurethane to achieve a
    greater grip when grasping. Polyurethane is a polymer composed of organic
    units joined by carbamate links. This enables the material to be flexible
    and durable at the same time, which is why no spring elements are required
    as restoring force

  <TextSection title="Engine Mount">
    The motor mount provides space for four Dynamixel XL-330 inside the casing
    and two additional motors attached to the side. These are required for the
    control of the oppunable thumb. On the left side the microcontroller and a
    voltage converter find their place. The fingers are removably attached to
    the motor mount and can be easily removed for maintenance and replacement.
